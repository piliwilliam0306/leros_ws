**Usage:**
```bash
python3 examples/20_subscribe_battery_state.py                   # subscribe to /battery_state
python3 examples/20_subscribe_battery_state.py /my/battery/topic
```

## Running Examples

Make sure you have:
1. Zenoh router running in a ROS2 environment:
   ```bash
   ros2 run rmw_zenoh_cpp rmw_zenohd
   ```
2. Set `ROS_DOMAIN_ID` if your ROS 2 domain is not 0
3. Set the correct `router_ip` if not using localhost

Each example is self-contained and uses the message registry to automatically load message definitions. You can copy and modify these examples for your own use cases.

## Debugging Pub/Sub Discovery (rmw_zenoh compatibility)

This SDK matches `rmw_zenoh_cpp`/`ros-z` conventions by using:

- **Data-plane key expressions** (payload transport):
  - `<domain_id>/<fully_qualified_name>/<dds_type_name>/<type_hash>`
- **Discovery-plane liveliness tokens** (ROS graph / publish-on-subscribe):
  - `@ros2_lv/<domain_id>/<session_id>/<node_id>/<entity_id>/<kind>/.../<qos>`

Entity kinds:
- `NN`: node
- `MP`: message publisher
- `MS`: message subscriber
- `SS`: service server
- `SC`: service client

If ROS tools can see a topic but you receive no data, confirm there is an `MS` token for that topic. Some publishers (notably camera/image pipelines) only start producing data after they discover at least one subscriber.

## QoS (rmw_zenoh / ros-z format)

This SDK uses the same compact QoS encoding as `rmw_zenoh_cpp` / `ros-z` for liveliness tokens:

`<Reliability>:<Durability>:<HistoryKind,HistoryDepth>:<DeadlineSec,DeadlineNSec>:<LifespanSec,LifespanNSec>:<LivelinessKind,LivelinessSec,LivelinessNSec>`

Examples:

- Default (KeepLast depth 10, reliable, volatile): `::,10:,:,:,,"`

You can pass either:
- the **encoded string** via `qos="::,10:,:,:,,"`, or
- a `QosProfile` object from `zenoh_ros2_sdk.qos`.
